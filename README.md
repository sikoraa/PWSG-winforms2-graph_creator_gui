# Graph Visualiser

Graph Visualiser is a WinForms app that lets you draw undirected graphs and edit them.

## Installation
Download the .exe and run it, or download the project and build it yourself!

## Features

- Drawing vertices with left mouse clicks on the canvas
- Selecting vertices with right clicks on the vertex
- While a vertex is selected, a left click on another one draws an edge between them
- While a vertex is selected, moving the cursos with middle button clicked moves the selected vertex around
- You can draw vertices in different colors
- You can delete a selected vertex
- Graphs are fully serializable - you can save them to a .graph file and load them up later.
- Multilingual support: Polish and English (works in runtime)
